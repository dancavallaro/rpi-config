            # seems to present the default cert instead of this one. To get around that, I have
            # noTLSVerify=true in the cloudflared config, since "traefik.traefik" fails validation
            # against "*.o.cavnet.cloud". This could all be avoided by just letting Cloudflare
            # terminate TLS and forward plain HTTP to Traefik, but that doesn't work because I
            # have Traefik configured to always forward port 80 to 443. Le sigh...
